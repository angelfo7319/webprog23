# webprog23

My name is Angel Flores and I am majoring in computer science. Thus far, I have taken the classes titled CS1, CS2, and CS3 where I learned JavaScript, my first coding language. I expanded my knowledge by learning about data structures/algorithms, object-oriented programming, C/C++, and some CSS/HTML/PHP. I have not done any personal programs yet outside of class, so far, I have only done smaller-scale assignments that have been assigned in class. This semester I am looking to do my first larger-scale project.

With the knowledge I expect to learn throughout this course I have intentions of ultimately creating my own app. I am going to be exposed to a lot of different new tools that make the process of creating and developing these apps more efficient. Web programming is a major space in the subject of Computer Science, and it is also a potential career choice for me. The end goal of studying is to ultimately become knowledgeable in a certain area or topic so that you can apply that knowledge in a future job. This course seems like it will be a little challenging but sticking through it and putting the work in will allow me to be more proficient in my area of study also making future courses I take easier.
